# CURRENT — wdk-wallet-web

**Last touched:** 2026-05-28 (CSO re-audit clean + CI hardened)
**Status (2026-05-28):** `/cso` re-audit at HEAD `e0c0363` — CLEAN. Live `pnpm audit --prod`: 0 crit/high/mod, 1 LOW (transitive `elliptic` via WDK BTC SDK, no upstream fix, not exploitable client-side — persists from 27.05, Solana port added NO new advisory). Crypto vault / CSP / static headers / secrets / supply chain / WDK containment all VERIFIED. PR#2 regression class now test-guarded (drift guard imports SOLANA_PUBLIC_RPCS). Report: `.gstack/security-reports/2026-05-28-cso.json`. Then HARDENED CI (commit `4041381`, pushed): top-level `permissions: contents: read` + all 3 actions SHA-pinned to v4 (checkout 34e1148, setup-node 49933ea, pnpm/action-setup f40ffcd). Both optional-hardening items from the audit now closed. Project is publicly shippable.

**Prior status:** Solana ported, PR #1 MERGED into main (merge `bb4b1df`; feat 6584e13 + docs cd893a5). verify GREEN on merged main (First Load 234 kB). **Deployed live via `railway up`** (deployment 6f8deb2f → SUCCESS) — Railway is NOT GitHub-auto-deploy so merge alone didn't ship it. Verified live: HTTP 200, full nonce-CSP + HSTS/X-Frame/nosniff/Referrer/Permissions headers present, fresh chunk f3fa99a5 (was d10ef6dd pre-Solana), bundle contains `solana` chain id ×4 + `"SOL"` + USDT-Solana mint Es9vMFr. `srcmono` local remote already removed. main==origin/main. Prior state: all 3 independent-audit findings fixed + /cso clean. URL: https://wdk-wallet-web-production.up.railway.app.

## Solana port (2026-05-27) — public is now canonical
Source monorepo (C:\Projects\tether-dev-grants) and this public repo had FORKED: public was ahead on Phase-5 watch-only + CSP/CI/Railway; source was ahead on Solana (be50cb4 wip + tests + docs). Yana decided "Solana → вперёд на public": port Solana forward, public becomes canonical. NET Solana change applied as clean diffs (NOT raw cherry-pick — path-prefix differs + wdk-core.ts touched by both Phase-5 and Solana).
- Code (6584e13): chains/index.ts (SOLANA_PUBLIC_RPCS, USDT_SOLANA mint, SOL_NATIVE 9-dec, solanaRpcUrls override, solana registry branch + DEFAULT_ASSETS row), wdk/types.ts (SolanaChainConfig), wdk-core.ts (WalletManagerSolana/WalletAccountReadOnlySolana, feeAssetFor SOL branch, register/account-build/getTransactionStatus — merged with watch-only path), types.ts ChainId +"solana", package.json pin @tetherto/wdk-wallet-solana@1.0.0-beta.8, apps/next explorer.ts Solscan tx/account.
- **tron stayed purged**: my conflict resolution initially re-added "tron" from source's union → caught via explorer.ts TS2741 + this file's Phase-4/6 "tron removed everywhere" note. Removed it; union == exactly the 6 modelled chains (no dangling member). engine.ts isWellFormedAddress widened "evm"|"btc" → +"solana" (base58 = existing alphanumeric branch).
- Tests/docs (also 6584e13 + cd893a5): chains.test.ts Solana coverage describe + modelled-registry assertion +solana; engine.test.ts portfolio 4→5 USD₮ + solana chain; README + ARCHITECTURE Solana-shipped reconcile (84-green, honest CI bound = only ETH+BTC-fixture e2e; Lightning/Spark sole "not shipped"; Next First Load ≈234 kB).
- **Cleanup DONE**: `srcmono` local remote removed (only `origin` remains).
- **DEPLOY DONE**: merged main shipped via `railway up` (deployment 6f8deb2f, SUCCESS, Solana confirmed live).
- **AUTO-DEPLOY LIVE + VERIFIED (2026-05-27)**: pushes to `main` now auto-deploy. Yana granted the Railway GitHub App access to the repo (Settings → Applications → Railway → Configure → Repository access), then `deploymentTriggerCreate` succeeded → repoTrigger `3cc53dda-8d66-4f18-bfe3-62aded0f10dc` (branch main) + serviceInstance source.repo set. PROVEN: pushing `872df51` auto-triggered a deploy with that commitHash → BUILDING→SUCCESS, no manual step. Manual `railway up` (token ~/.config/railway-token.env) still works as a fallback.
- **Solana CSP fix (PR #2, 9c37043) is LIVE**: my Solana port added the chain but missed adding Solana RPC origins to the static `cspAllowlist.ts`, so the nonce-CSP silently blocked every SPL USD₮ balance fetch on the deployed wallet (drift guard was vacuously green — Solana absent on both sides). PR #2 added `https://solana-rpc.publicnode.com` + `https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com` to DEFAULT_RPC_ORIGINS, taught the drift guard to import SOLANA_PUBLIC_RPCS (gap closed), and added a `solanaRpcUrls` override for per-chain parity. Verified on prod: live `connect-src` now contains both Solana origins.

## Independent re-audit fixes (2026-05-27)
- [x] Finding 3 [P3] — watch-only label could not be cleared back to unnamed. `watchOnly.ts addWatchWallet` now distinguishes explicit blank set (clears) from omitted (keeps); page.tsx onStartWatch passes label unconditionally. +2 tests (17 watchOnly). Commit 40d4795.
- [x] Finding 1 [P1] — Data Sources indexer was dead (persisted but never wired). New `historyProvider.ts` HTTP client + injected into createWalletEngine when indexerMode=indexer && indexerUrl. Hardened untrusted JSON, [] on any failure → core falls back to local log. +9 tests. Commit eb7fe41.
- [x] Finding 2 [P1] — runtime custom RPC/price/indexer origins blocked by the static nonce CSP (Edge middleware can't read localStorage). Yana picked **Variant B** (keep strict CSP — it's the product's pitch). Done: new shared `cspAllowlist.ts` (Edge-safe, no wallet-core import) is the SINGLE source both `middleware.ts` and the Data Sources UI read, so they can't drift; the defaults↔wallet-core RPC link is drift-guarded by `test/cspAllowlist.test.ts` (Node-only). Data Sources card now computes `cspBlockedOrigins()` from the live form and warns inline which origins this deploy will block. `dataSources.ts` narrows http:→https: and ws:→wss: in production builds (dev keeps insecure for localhost). +cspAllowlist tests +3 dataSources tests. SECURITY-REVIEW.md §6 updated. Chainlist integration DEFERRED post-bounty (doesn't fix this; web app bound by own CSP unlike extensions). Commit f9c4286, PUSHED, CI green.

## ✅ RAILWAY DEPLOY FRESH (2026-05-27) — resolved
f9c4286 is LIVE. Redeployed via `railway up` (token in ~/.config/railway-token.env, RAILWAY_API_TOKEN). New deployment ec1f4ea0 = SUCCESS. Verified: HTTP 200, nonce-CSP + all security headers present, live page chunk now contains f9c4286's new strings ("will block requests" count=1; chunk hash d10ef6dd, was 67431dd4 when stale).

ROOT CAUSE / FOLLOW-UP: the service is NOT wired to GitHub auto-deploy — only deploy mechanism is manual `railway up` (uploads local working dir, builds NIXPACKS per railway.json). So git pushes do NOT deploy. Before stale fix only 1 deploy ever existed (2026-05-26 22:23, no-sha). FUTURE: either keep running `railway up` after green pushes, OR connect the service to the GitHub repo + enable auto-deploy on main (Railway dashboard → service → Settings → Source). Verify-fresh one-liner: `BASE=https://wdk-wallet-web-production.up.railway.app; P=$(curl -sS $BASE/ | grep -oE '/_next/static/chunks/app/page-[^"]+\.js' | head -1); curl -sS --compressed "$BASE$P" | grep -c "will block requests"` → 1=fresh.

## Status
- [x] Deep audit done (findings folded into `docs/BOUNTY-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`)
- [x] Phase 0: Baseline Integrity — all working-tree work committed in 6 scoped commits + pushed; `origin/main == HEAD`; verify green (76 wallet-core + 13 svelte tests, 223 kB First Load)
- [x] Phase 1: Payment Request QR — Receive Address/Request switch, EIP-681/BIP-21 builders (`paymentRequest.ts`), 14 vitest tests in apps/next, QR+copy. Commit 0be4966.
- [x] Phase 2: Pre-Send Safety Panel — `safety.ts` (classify recipient, poisoning, official-token) + SafetyPanel in confirmation block + `addressExplorerUrl`; 12 tests. Commit 7d0da81.
- [x] Phase 3: Address Book v2 — note/favorite/last-used, edit, save-as-template, Send templates row; load hardening. Commits d7a3c75 (data) + 7c2aa30 (UI). 32 apps/next tests.
- [x] Phase 4: Data Sources / Privacy Settings — dataSources.ts module + 12 tests, engine layering (persisted>env>defaults), CoinGecko gated+disclosed, `tron` ChainId removed everywhere, Settings card w/ 4 privacy labels. Commits 2810a37/15dea6f/283a7a1/3455308. 44 apps/next tests.
- [x] Phase 5: Watch-Only Mode — seedless `getBalancesForAddress` in wallet-core (+3 tests), `watchOnly.ts` host module (+15 tests), onboarding Watch tab + read-only portfolio + disabled-send notice + receive. wallet-core 79 / apps/next 59 tests. Commits: core (1/2), module (2/2a), UI (2/2b).
- [x] Phase 6: nonce CSP (middleware.ts) + smoke.mjs + SECURITY-REVIEW.md + corrected SECURITY.md. Commits 1653c59/00be987/0e0e248. Cross-cutting `tron` cleanup confirmed done (absent from ChainId union, test asserts it).

## Plan source of truth
`docs/BOUNTY-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` — read it fully before starting. Audit
blind-zones are marked "(Audit 2026-05-26)" inside the relevant phases + a new
"## Phase 0" + "## Cross-cutting cleanups" section. Do NOT remove existing
fixes — Yana wants a very strong product, so implement the WHOLE plan.

## Cold review findings 2026-05-27 (3 fresh-context adversarial subagents)
Subagents VERIFIED core crypto is genuinely correct + honestly documented: PBKDF2-600k, HKDF-SHA256, AES-GCM-256, non-extractable keys, fresh salt/IV, worker spawn (adapter.ts:21), nonce CSP (all 11 directives match docs byte-for-byte), tron fully purged. sodium_memzero is REAL (not no-op). No faked crypto, no predictable nonces.

Fixes to apply (priority order):
- [x] [P0] safety.ts isOfficialToken was chain-blind → official-Tether badge spoofable across chains. FIXED: officialTokenContracts keys by `chain:token`; isOfficialToken checks `asset.chain:token`. + detectPoisoning now includes ownAddresses (was missing send-to-self trap). + regression test. NOT yet committed/verified.
- [x] [P1] contacts.ts:123/129/138 — case-SENSITIVE dedupe/match, desyncs from case-insensitive classifier; breaks touchContact + recent-sort. FIXED: normalize EVM addr lowercase in add/remove/update/touch (BTC case-sensitive). Commit b5f12cd.
- [x] [P1] paymentRequest.ts — recipient addr emitted verbatim, no validation. FIXED: assertValidRecipient + InvalidAddressError, runs before URI build; EVM 0x+40hex, BTC delimiter-free. +3 tests (17). Commit 0d0a396.
- [x] [P2] engine.ts getBalancesForAddress — no addr validation in core (only UI). FIXED: isWellFormedAddress + core InvalidAddressError, validates every in-scope chain BEFORE building reader. +1 test (80). Commit 191c3d1. (NOTE: hit a 1-byte NUL corruption in engine.ts mid-edit; found via python byte-scan, fixed, all committed blobs verified 0 nulls.)
- [x] [DOC] DONE. README.md drop "ETH" from send/receive (both line 11 + line 29: "ETH only as the gas token"). next.config.mjs:39 stripped unused fullscreen=(self)→fullscreen=() (verified unused in app; aligns w/ honest "only camera" prose, no test asserts it). SECURITY-REVIEW.md:115 NEXT_PUBLIC_*→NEXT_PUBLIC_ETHEREUM_RPC_URLS (only var middleware.ts:53 folds into connect-src). §2 added unzeroable-seed-string caveat (buffers memzero'd, phrase=immutable string → drop-for-GC, matches wdk-core dispose). §6 added "apps/svelte ships WITHOUT CSP/headers" scope note. ARCHITECTURE.md 76→80 (line 351), 223→232 kB (lines 61/179/290). BOUNTY-CHECKLIST 79→80 / 59→63 / 228→232. RN-TO-WEB-MAP 223→232. Authoritative from fresh verify: 80 wallet-core + 63 next + 13 svelte tests, 232 kB First Load. Commit pending.
- [x] [P1 verify] unlock.ts passphrase lingered for module-singleton lifetime. VERIFIED real: resetSecrets() cleared only LOCAL passphrase, not the provider's #passphrase. FIXED: resetSecrets() now also calls getWalletApp().setPassphrase("") in BOTH apps (next page.tsx:576, svelte App.svelte:263). Could NOT clear inside provider.unlock() — create/import call unlock() internally via persistSeed, and flows do a 2nd unlock relying on persistence. verify green, 232 kB First Load. Commit pending.
- [x] [P1 verify] wdk-core.ts:105-110 #seedPhrase not nulled on dispose. FIXED: field now `string | null`; dispose() nulls it (drops ref for GC, immutable strings can't be wiped — documented honestly); reencrypt() throws WalletLockedError once disposed. typecheck clean, 0 NULs. Commit eec535a.
- NOT fixing: connect-src `wss:` wholesale (by design, Electrum operator-supplied, can't pin server-side; already documented).

## Optional polish (all 3 done this session, after Yana picked "Всё три")
- [x] HSTS + Permissions-Policy headers in next.config.mjs headers() + documented in SECURITY-REVIEW.md §6. Commit 5466e6b.
- [x] Run E2E smoke in CI — new `smoke` job in .github/workflows/ci.yml (only job proving nonce-CSP/hydration at runtime). Commit a38ba84.
- [x] Expand smoke to cover Phase 1 (payment-request panel) + Phase 5 (watch-only signing-disabled), via walletFlow()/watchOnlyFlow(). 6 assertions PASS. Commit 15845c1.

## Product depth (Yana picked #1 BTC testnet e2e + #3 a11y)
- [x] #3 A11y pass — DONE. New `tools/e2e/a11y.mjs` (axe-core WCAG 2.0/2.1 A+AA,
  8 screens, `pnpm a11y`, threshold gate A11Y_FAIL_ON default serious, bypassCSP
  in audit browser only). Fixed: aria-label on all bare selects; unified the 3
  Data Sources/settings selects (one-off `bg-[#111] text-white` → canonical
  `bg-[--color-bg]`; native control was scored dark-on-dark by axe); added
  `color-scheme: dark` to globals.css. 0 violations across all 8 screens.
  verify + smoke + a11y all green. Commit 4458dc7, pushed.
- [x] #1 BTC live e2e — DONE (commit 0d79470). New `tools/e2e/btc-live.mjs` +
  `pnpm btc:live`. Runs the REAL WDK adapter (createWdkAdapter() on Node →
  WdkCoreAdapter in-process, no Worker) and reads a live on-chain balance over a
  real Electrum-WS endpoint — the genuine @tetherto transport that FakeWdkAdapter
  (pnpm test) and BTC-unconfigured smoke never exercised (gap was called out in
  engine.test.ts bitcoin block). Outside the workspace → vitest never collects it,
  verify stays offline; opt-in only. Default = genesis coinbase on mainnet over
  Blockstream `wss://blockstream.info/electrum-websocket/api`, assert ≥ 50 BTC
  (genesis balance only grows → never flakes). Env-overridable
  (BTC_LIVE_WS_URL/NETWORK/ADDRESS/MIN_SATS) for testnet/signet. Verified live:
  read 57.2 BTC, PASS. NOTE for Yana: she said "testnet"; I used mainnet-genesis
  read-only as a STRONGER proof (same network the product ships, immutable
  balance, zero risk) — testnet endpoint plugs into the same harness via env.
- [x] Solana live e2e — DONE (commit 5cde2b5). New `tools/e2e/sol-live.mjs` +
  `pnpm sol:live`, mirrors btc-live: real createWdkAdapter() in-process →
  `reader.getTokenBalance("solana", USDT_SOLANA, owner)` over a live mainnet-beta
  RPC (solana-rpc.publicnode.com). Closes the gap PR #2 exposed (Solana was the
  only shipped chain with ZERO live exercise). Default owner 5tzFkiKsc… (long-lived
  ~$160M USD₮ holder), floor 1 USD₮ → can't flake; all overridable via
  SOL_LIVE_RPC_URL/ADDRESS/TOKEN/MIN. Outside workspace → verify stays offline.
  Verified live: read 160,364,551 USD₮, PASS. Documented like btc:live (package.json
  // comment + file header; neither is in README, parity kept).

## Next step
ALL THREE FOCUS ITEMS DONE (cold review → product depth → live deploy).
Live deploy SHIPPED on **Railway** (NOT Vercel): project `wdk-wallet-web`
(id ea62a935-9782-444a-bbef-72797484bee8), service `wdk-wallet-web`
(id 90c1dc50-75f4-4ea2-abbe-021201628391), env `production`. Deploy config =
committed `railway.json` (NIXPACKS; build = pnpm install + wallet-core build +
next build; start = `next start -p $PORT`). Public URL:
https://wdk-wallet-web-production.up.railway.app — verified HTTP 200, live
per-request CSP nonce (`strict-dynamic`), HSTS/X-Frame-Options DENY/nosniff/
Referrer-Policy/Permissions-Policy all present. App boots with NO mandatory env
vars (public RPC defaults; indexer/BTC optional). Created two duplicate projects
during `railway init` (response timed out but created); deleted the dupe, kept one.

Remaining-optional (NOT blocking, Yana's call):
- `/cso` full multi-agent pass before broad public sharing (п.4). Headers/CSP
  already strong; surface is small (client-side self-custodial, no server secrets).
- Optional: add live URL to README demo section for the bounty submission.

Final green this session (HEAD 0d79470):
  - `corepack pnpm verify`: lint+typecheck+build OK, 80 (wallet-core) + 63 (next) + 13 (svelte) tests.
  - `corepack pnpm smoke`: PASS under live nonce CSP, 6 assertions (zero blocking CSP violations).
  - `corepack pnpm a11y`: PASS, 0 violations across 8 screens (WCAG 2.0/2.1 A+AA, threshold serious).
  - `corepack pnpm btc:live`: PASS, live Blockstream read 57.2 BTC ≥ 50 BTC floor.

## CSP rework note (important for any future toucher)
The first CSP attempt (static header in next.config) was WRONG — `script-src 'self'`
blocks Next's inline RSC-bootstrap scripts, so the app never mounts. Correct design
NOW shipped: per-request nonce in `apps/next/middleware.ts` (`'self' 'nonce-…'
'strict-dynamic'`), and `app/layout.tsx` is `async` + `await headers()` to force
per-request (dynamic) rendering so the nonce reaches the inline scripts. Do NOT
revert to a static CSP. Non-CSP headers (nosniff/Referrer-Policy/X-Frame-Options)
stay in next.config headers().

## Remaining after Phase 3
- Phase 4: Data Sources/Privacy Settings (+ disclose/toggle CoinGecko in `prices.ts`;
  resolve `tron` dangling ChainId — now also in `explorer.ts` EXPLORERS map; endpoints = CSP connect-src list).
- Phase 5: Watch-Only Mode (EVM address watch, disabled signing).
- Phase 6: E2E smoke (`tools/e2e/smoke.mjs` + `smoke` script) + SECURITY-REVIEW.md
  + CORRECT SECURITY.md (remove phantom hardware-wallet path; make "strict CSP" real)
  + SHIP real CSP header via `next.config.mjs headers()`.

## Decisions / constraints
- Honesty is the product's whole pitch — fixing SECURITY.md's false claims
  (phantom hardware-wallet path; "strict CSP" with no CSP deployed) is as
  important as any feature. Both live in Phase 6.
- Non-negotiables (from plan): keep glass UI, no landing page, no hardcoded
  public history fetch in wallet-core, no seed re-exposure, don't weaken
  passphrase unlock, no `localStorage.clear()`, test-backed core changes.
- No Claude/AI traces in commits/PRs/docs; Yana = sole author.
- CoinGecko fetch (`prices.ts`) is allowed (host layer, address-free) but must
  be disclosed + toggleable in Phase 4 and listed in CSP connect-src.

## Audit verdict recap (already in chat)
Crypto core strong (PBKDF2-600k / HKDF-for-PRF / non-extractable keys / real
Web Worker seed isolation / ESLint WDK containment). Green lint+typecheck+build.
Top gaps were: uncommitted baseline (FIXED), no CSP, false SECURITY.md claims,
undisclosed CoinGecko, `tron` dangling — all now tracked in the plan.
